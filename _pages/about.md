Hello! My name is **Han Wang**, and I am currently an undergraduate student at the [Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/), majoring in **Artificial Intelligence**. Currently I work on the Audio Research Team at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of [Prof. Zhou Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou).

My academic interests lie in **machine learning, Multi-Modal Generative AI**, and I am passionate about exploring how AI can be applied to solve real-world problems. At CKC, I have been developing a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of AI, while actively seeking opportunities for research and interdisciplinary collaboration.

If you'd like to connect or discuss potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out to me at **[wanghanzju@gmail.com](mailto:wanghanzju@gmail.com)**.
